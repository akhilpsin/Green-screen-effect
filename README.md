# Green screen effect: A Personal Web Project  
  
## Overview  
This personal project demonstrates the implementation of the chroma key compositing technique, commonly known as the green screen effect, using the trio of foundational web technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application allows users to seamlessly integrate two images by replacing a uniformly green background with a selected scene or pattern, exemplifying a simplified version of the visual effects used in film and photography.  
  
## Features  
- **Green Screen Effect**: Replace the green background of an image with another image of your choice.  
- **Interactive Interface**: User-friendly design for easy navigation and operation.  
- **Real-Time Preview**: Instantly view the composited result as you select different backgrounds.  
- **Customization**: Adjust the green threshold to fine-tune the chroma key effect.  
  
## Technologies Used  
- **HTML**: Structuring and presenting content on the web page.  
- **CSS**: Styling the user interface with responsive design.  
- **JavaScript**: Enabling interactive features and image processing logic.
